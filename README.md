# Advent of code 2020
Here are scripts written for the advent calendar which is accessible on https://adventofcode.com/2020/. I was trying to improve my Go skills during this advent so I wrote all the code in Go.

Below you can find table with my feelings about complexity of every of the days, so as about my stars and link to the assignment.
